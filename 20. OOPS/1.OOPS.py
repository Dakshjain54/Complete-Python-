Introduction to Object-oriented programming:
In programming languages, mainly there are two approaches that are used to write program or code.
1). Procedural Programming
2). Object-Oriented Programming

The procedure we are following till now is the “Procedural Programming” approach. So, in this session, we will learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP). 
The basic idea of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python is to use classes and objects to represent real-world concepts and entities.

In summary, OOP in Python allows developers to model real-world concepts and entities using classes and objects, 
encapsulate data, reuse code through inheritance, and write more flexible code through polymorphism.
